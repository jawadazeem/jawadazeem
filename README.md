# Hi, I'm Jawad Azeem

I’m a developer interested in backend engineering, cloud computing, and applied machine learning. I use this space to build projects, explore new tools, and document what I’m learning.

## 🔧 Technical Skills
- **Backend & APIs:** Java, Spring Boot, RESTful Services
- **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS)  
- **Web Development:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Data & ML:** Python, Pandas, data processing workflows  
- **Tools:** Git, Linux, Postman, IntelliJ, VS Code  

## 📂 Projects

### 📡 Telecom Billing Processor (Java ETL + Spring Boot API)
- Built an end-to-end ETL workflow that parses telecom billing CSVs, transforms data, and provides analytics through REST endpoints.  
- Designed immutable domain models and implemented aggregation using Java Streams.  
- Applied layered architecture (controller → service → ETL) and added persistence through repository patterns.

### 🧠 EEG Signal Processing & Machine Learning Pipeline
- Developed a Python-based workflow for EEG analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.  
- Processed raw EEG signals, visualized patterns, and evaluated ML models to explore relationships between activity and stimuli.
